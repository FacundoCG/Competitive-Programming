# Competitive Programming

Welcome to my Competitive Programming repository! This repository contains solutions to various competitive programming problems from different online judges and contests, as well as a collection of algorithm and data structure implementations.

## Solutions

### CSES
This folder contains solutions to problems from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/). The problems cover various topics including sorting, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and more.

### Codeforces Contests
Here you will find solutions to problems from various [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) contests. Each subfolder is named after the contest and contains solutions to the problems from that contest.

### LeetCode75
This section includes solutions to the problems from the [LeetCode75](https://leetcode.com/study-plan/leetcode-75/) study plan, which is designed to help improve problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.

### HackerRank
This folder contains solutions to problems from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). The problems are from various domains such as algorithms and data structures.

### Training Camp
Solutions to problems from various training camp events are stored here. These events are usually designed to simulate competitive programming contests and help improve problem-solving speed and accuracy.

### UBA
This folder includes solutions from contests organized by the University of Buenos Aires. The problems in these contests are typically tailored to challenge and improve the programming skills of university students.

## Notebook
The Notebook folder is a collection of implementations of various algorithms and data structures. This includes:

- **Graph Algorithms:** Implementations of algorithms such as Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall, and others.
- **Divide and Conquer Algorithms:** Examples include merge sort, binary search, and more.
- **Greedy Algorithms:** Implementation of algorithms that make locally optimal choices.
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Different sorting techniques like bubble sort, insertion sort, etc.
- **Data Structures:** Implementations of priority queue, disjoint union set, graphs, and other data structures.

Feel free to explore and use the code provided in this repository. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy Coding!
